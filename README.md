# Low-Cost Smart Waste Segregation Bin (₹3k Target)

Goal:
Create a smart waste segregation bin under ₹3,000 retail price.

## Features
- Automatic lid opening (Ultrasonic sensor)
- Wet/Dry detection (Moisture sensor)
- Servo-based internal flap mechanism
- Simple, low-cost design

## Hardware Used
- Arduino / ESP32
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Capacitive Moisture Sensor
- 2 Servo Motors
- Plastic dual-compartment bin

## Estimated Cost
Prototype cost: ₹2,000
Target retail price: ₹3,000 – ₹3,500

## Current Challenges
- Moisture sensor durability
- Long-term servo reliability
- Improving detection accuracy
- Reducing production cost

## Looking For Feedback
- Better wet/dry detection alternatives?
- Lower-cost actuator mechanisms?
- Suggestions for mass manufacturing?

Open to collaboration and technical advice.
